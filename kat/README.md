##Assignment:
Create a Persistent HTTP server that can POST up notes in JSON format to *localhost:3000/notes* and show us the files name that we have created using this method.

##How to use:
In the terminal write **node server.js**
This will start your server and you should see the text *server live* in your terminal.
Open your browser and go to **localhost:3000/notes**
You can use a way of your choice to POST a json object to the previously stated url and see the file creation and change.
Or you can run **mocha** in the terminal for a built in way to POST.

##How to test
Type **mocha** into the terminal for unit tests.
Type **gulp lint** into the terminal for linting checks.
